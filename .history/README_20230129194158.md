## Errors I Faced

  1. The first error I faced was the version conflict error of npm version when installing sanity cli. I had to downgrade the npm version to 6.14.8 to install sanity cli.

  2. The second error I faced was upstream dependency conflict error in my node package manager (npm). I had to install the legacy peer dependency to resolve the error.

## Current Error
  
    1. The current error I am facing is after deployment on vercel there has been astyle conflict. I am trying to resolve it.
